    <h1>A Sweet Tale of My Puppy</h1>
      <p>This is a story of how <strong>Ozark</strong> added spice to our lives. We found him at the local shelter. It was a wet and <em>rainy</em> day.</p>
      <p>We first locked eyes with him while he was nestled in his kennel. The little guy was just a <strong>puppy</strong>, weighing less than <em>20 pounds</em>.</p>
